# JudgeGirl program

Solutions for JudgeGirl system for NTU CSIE.
Solutions may not be elegant, this is merely a backup of the program I wrote when I was first grade.
There may be some other things that are either temporary files, or doesn't even have anything to do with JudgeGirl. But what I did back then was just `git add .` and push / backup everything up here so...

Also if you are NTU CSIE's student and are looking up on the internet for answers... I suggest you not to do so before you actually ACed the problem. But after you got an AC, everyone's source code on the system will be available to you. So the conclusion is that you should probably leave here now.

But if you are other people that are actually interested in my (junior-time) coding skills there you go.
